# Let's talk Subject To.

Many investors turn to subject to real estate deals to purchase properties
without securing a mortgage. Subject to real estate is also a practical option
for those who need to buy/sell a home quickly and cost-effectively.

## What Does Subject To Mean in Real Estate?

In real estate, subject to means that you’re buying a home that’s subject to an
existing mortgage. Under normal circumstances, what happens when a homeowner
sells a property in which the mortgage hasn’t been fully paid off?

Most often, the proceeds of the sale are used to pay off the remaining mortgage,
and the seller pockets the rest. Or, the buyer may take over the remaining
mortgage, a process called “mortgage assumption.”

Subject to is a middle-ground between both options. Under a subject to, the
buyer agrees to make payments to the seller’s mortgage company until the
mortgage is fully paid off. The mortgage remains in the original owner’s name,
but the buyer pays it off.

At first glance, it appears that the seller takes on more risk since the buyer
has no legal obligation to make the mortgage payments. But even though the buyer
is not assuming the mortgage, the buyer is still taking the property title. If
the buyer stops making payments, the house will fall into foreclosure, and the
buyer will lose it.

Usually, that’s plenty of motivation for a buyer to uphold their end of the
bargain, especially since they have made a down payment that they done want to
lose.

In the case of a delinquent payment, a contract can state that the buyer and not
the sellers credit will be effected, by using a credit agency.

## Types of Subject To Real Estate Deals

There are three types of subject to real estate deals:

- Cash-to-loan subject to

- Seller carry back subject to

Let’s compare each one.

### Cash-to-Loan Subject To

A cash-to-loan subject to is the most simple and common type of subject to. When
you buy a home from a seller, you’ll pay the existing loan balance in cash.

For example, if you’re buying a home for $300,000, and the existing mortgage
balance is $250,000, then you’d pay the seller $50,000 in cash, in addition to
the sales price.

As you can see, the buyer isn’t assuming the mortgage. The buyer is just paying
forward an extra sum so the seller can pay the remaining balance.

When you hear people mention a subject to, they’re most often referring to a
cash-to-loan transaction.

### Seller Carryback Subject To

Seller carryback is also known as “seller financing” or “owner financing.” The
transaction is similar to a second mortgage.

A seller carryback may be a necessary option if a lender won’t offer the buyer
the total amount of financing needed to buy the property.

For example, let’s assume that a property is selling for $300,000. The buyer can
only secure financing for $250,000, so they receive a “loan” from the seller for
the remaining $50,000. The buyer makes payments to the lender on the $250,000
borrowed and makes payments to the seller for the $50,000 borrowed.

The seller doesn’t actually give the buyer any money—they just allow the buyer
to pay installments over a period.

## "Due on Sale" Clause

If the "due on sale" clause ever gets called, this can be avoided by
transferring the deed back into the seller's name. The contract can be changed
automatically to a lease option with the purchase price being $1 and the end of
the loan period - the rent amount being the mortgage payment. The lease would be
a typical commercial lease where the tenant takes care of all the expenses,
maintenance and repairs.

## DTI

By utilizing a payment servicing company it's able to prove a loan is being
"serviced", and thus the sellers credit is cleared of 75% of the DTI on year 1,
and 100% thereafter.
